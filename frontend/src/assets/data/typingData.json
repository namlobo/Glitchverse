  "text": "Did you know that the first computer bug was actually a real moth found trapped in a Harvard computer in 1947? Grace Hopper discovered it stuck between relay contacts and taped it into her logbook with the note: \"First actual case of bug being found.\" The term \"debugging\" comes from this literal removal of insects from early machines. Speaking of programming languages, Python was named after Monty Python’s Flying Circus, not the snake. Guido van Rossum was reading scripts from the comedy show when he created the language in 1989. Java got its name from coffee consumed by programmers at Sun Microsystems. The original name was Oak, but trademark issues forced a change. JavaScript has nothing to do with Java, despite the similar name. It was created in just ten days by Brendan Eich at Netscape. The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1991. He could have patented it and become incredibly wealthy, but chose to make it free for everyone. The first website ever created is still online at info.cern.ch. Linus Torvalds created Linux as a hobby project while studying at the University of Helsinki. He announced it on a Usenet newsgroup, saying it was just a free operating system for hackers. Today, Linux powers most of the internet servers worldwide. The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow down typists because early typewriters would jam if you typed too fast. Alan Turing proposed the famous Turing Test in 1950 to determine if machines could think. He also helped crack the Enigma code during World War II. The first computer game was Spacewar!, created by MIT students in 1962 on a PDP computer. It took them about 200 hours to write. Moore’s Law states that computer processing power doubles every two years. Gordon Moore made this observation in 1965, and it held true for decades."
